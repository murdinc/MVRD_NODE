# MVRD_NODE
Basic Communication Sketch for Arduino Based MVRD_CNTRLR_2.0 Nodes.

This is a basic node for testing the MVRD_CNTRLR_2.0. It is still a work in progress, but I believe it will control a tiny car. I will keep this small-ish, as a simple example. More specific nodes will be built off of this example.
